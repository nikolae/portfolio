## Me
I am Nick: an electrical engineer and software developer of 13+ years who has worked in the implantable medical product, aerospace, oil & gas, test & measurement, industrial automation, consumer product, and embedded circuit design spaces. I've done work for various Government labs ([NREL](https://nrel.gov), [Sandia](https://www.sandia.gov/)), Medtronic, Tesla, Google, Apple, John Deer, Wrigley, Intel, and many others. I was the recipient of two Engineering Impact awards in 2014: one from National Instruments for Energy and the other from National Instruments/Intel for Internet of Things. I am currently working on embedded class 3 medical implantable devices. I am passionate about technology for both work and pleasure, and enjoy reading with a cat on my lap.

## This Project
This project (the website), was born out of a long passion for building things with technology of any form. For web specifically, I remember getting my first [dot.tk](http://www.dot.tk/) domain (this still exists? neat!) when I was around 10 or 11 and building up a (very crude, by today's standards) HTML webpage. It had all the bells and whistles: scrolling text, a page hit counter, automatic music playing on page load! This was the pinnacle of high technology. Simpler times.

Fast forward to today, and I am a bona-fide engineer who still loves to tinker. This domain will serve to showcase any and all technical-related projects I've worked on (that I can disclose, or have done personally), be it circuit design, software architecture, woodworking, photography, or any other engineering-esque thing I get up to.

## The Goods
The website is generated by using Jekyll, a static site generator based on content I write. The pages are written using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), compiled for the site with Jekyll, then the generated HTML is pushed to my site's repo using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). In addition to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), raw [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) under the hood. I use a customized theme based on [Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/).
